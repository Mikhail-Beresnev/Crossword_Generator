# Crossword_Generator
Crossword generator which uses the backtracking algorithm to generate a crossword puzzle given a structure and a list of words <br />
To run, use the command 'python generate.py data/structure1.txt data/words1.txt', replacing the files as needed <br />
I did not make the sample structures, word lists
